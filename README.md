# Skipperz Club Nairobi Website 🌟

This is a simple HTML & CSS project created as part of my school assignment.  
It showcases the **Skipperz Club Nairobi**, a youth-led community promoting fitness, wellness, and fun through rope skipping.  

The project also includes a **Flexbox Demonstration Page**, showing different layout techniques used in the main site.
